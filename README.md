The goal of ERA5-spatial_and_temporal is to construct a spatio-temporal model during hurricane events in Florida. It contains the following files:

* 01-Extract_ws_and_tp.R: extract the necessary variable from the NetCDF files.
* 02-Extreme_value.R: find the threshold and extract extreme values.
* 03_EDA.R: plot the movement of hurricane and distribution of climate variables.
* 04_correlation.R: plot distribution of correlation in map.
* inla.R: fit the spatio-temporal model by using INLA package.
